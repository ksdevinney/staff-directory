## About 

This application lists non-sensitive information about employees. The user can sort employee names alphabetically and search for employees by name. Data is dynamically updated on the page.

## Development

This application is built using React. Components on the page include the list of names, the rows in the table, the search bar, and the wrapper for the table.

Data is pulled from the [RandomUser.me API](https://randomuser.me/). Personal information is randomly generated.

This application is deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://ksdevinney.github.io/staff-directory/).
